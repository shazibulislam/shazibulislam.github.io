Hi there! I am Shamim, a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Software Engineering in the [College of Computing and Software Engineering (CSSE)](https://www.kennesaw.edu/ccse/index.php) at [Kennesaw State University](https://www.kennesaw.edu/). I earned my PhD in Computer Science and Software Engineering from [Auburn University](https://www.auburn.edu/) under the supervision of Dr. Akond Rahman. Prior to that, I completed my bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). My research lies in software engineering with a strong focus on open-source and cloud-native security, particularly in the context of DevOps, secure software development, and software supply-chain resilience. I study how security vulnerabilities emerge from misconfiguration, automation pipelines, and dependency management in modern open-source ecosystems, and I develop practitioner-oriented solutions to mitigate these risks. Previously, I received the Bronze Award in the [ACM Student Research Competition](https://2021.esec-fse.org/info/awards) at FSE 2021 in the graduate category.


<span style = "color: red; font-weight: bold;"> Currently I am looking for a PhD student to join in my research group from Fall 2026. </span>
