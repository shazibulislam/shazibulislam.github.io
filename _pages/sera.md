I lead the Software Engineering Research and Analysis (SERA) group at Kennesaw State University, with a research focus on open-source security and cloud-native systems. The group investigates software engineering challenges related to misconfiguration, dependency risk, and supply-chain compromise, with the goal of producing actionable security improvements for open-source communities.
