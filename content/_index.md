              * Created a map between AWS CIS Kubernetes recommendations and the rules of open-source Kubernetes security analysis tools.
              * Designed and conducted a survey among the practitioners to understand their perceptions of Kubernetes CIS recommendations.
              * Created an Oracle dataset from the proprietary repositories and executed static analysis tools on the Oracle dataset.
              * Reported precision, recall and low agreements, coverage among the static analysis tools on the static analysis results.
              * Collaborated with the product security team to execute dynamic analysis tools in production clusters and reported low AWS CIS Kubernetes recommendation coverage and low agreement among the dynamic analysis tool.

              * Collaborated with the data team and internal stakeholders to identify 66 relevant attributes out of 780 in the data of the past 24 months.
              * Performed feature selection on the relevant attributes and identified 15 attributes that are correlated more with the freight inspection.
              * Conducted statistical analysis and created visualizations to explore freight inspection, which is a rare event ($<$0.02\%).
              * Developed several machine learning models for freight inspection prediction, and proposed an autoencoder model that outperformed other models by uncovering latent patterns in the data related to freight inspection.
