abstract: Scientific software is defined as software that is used to explore and analyze data to investigate unanswered research questions in the scientific community [6]. The domain of scientific software includes software needed to construct a research pipeline such as software for simulation and data analysis, large-scale dataset management, and mathematical libraries [4]. Programming languages such as Julia [1] are used to develop scientific software efficiently and achieve desired program execution time. Julia was used in Celeste1, a software used in astronomy research. Celeste was used to load 178 terabytes of astronomical image data to produce a catalog of 188 million astronomical objects in 14.6 minutes2. The Celeste-related example provides anecdotal evidence on the value of studying Julia-related projects from a cybersecurity perspective.
