abstract: Kubernetes is an open source software that helps in automated deployment of software and orchestration of containers. With Kubernetes, IT organizations, such as IBM, Pinterest, and Spotify have experienced an increase in release frequency. The goal of this paper is to inform practitioners and researchers on benefits and challenges of Kubernetes usage by conducting a multi-vocal literature review of Kubernetes. We conduct a multi-vocal literature review (MLR) where we use 321 Kubernetes-related Internet artifacts to identify benefits and challenges perceived by practitioners. In our MLR, we also analyze 105 peer-reviewed publications to identify the research topics addressed by the research community. We find 8 benefits that include service level objective (SLO)-based scalability and self-healing containers. Our identified 15 challenges related to Kubernetes include unavailability of diagnostics and security tools and attack surface reduction. We observe researchers to address 14 research topics related to Kubernetes, which includes efficient resource utilization. We also identify 9 challenges that are under-explored in research publications, which include cultural change, hardware compatibility, learning curve, maintenance, and testing.
