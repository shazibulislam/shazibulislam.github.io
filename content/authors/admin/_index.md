I am a Ph.D. candidate and Graduate Research Assistant at Auburn University, AL, USA, working in the Computer Science and Software Engineering Department. I hold a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in CSE from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) and have previously worked as a Software Engineer (DevOps) at a Fin-Tech start-up, iPay Systems Limited, in Bangladesh.

I am passionate about DevOps, Software Security, and Cybersecurity education. My research focuses on developing security analysis tools and innovative techniques for software practitioners, enabling them to better understand and implement security measures in their software applications. Currently, I am working in the Practical and Actionable Software Engineering Research (PASER) group at Auburn University, where I collaborate with Professor Dr. Akond Rahman. We are developing security analysis tools and techniques to help practitioners prevent security misconfigurations in Kubernetes-based container deployments. Additionally, we are working on creating hands-on cybersecurity exercises for students.
