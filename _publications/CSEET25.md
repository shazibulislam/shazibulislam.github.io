Kubernetes has become a popular tool for automated container orchestration. Despite reported benefits, practitioners report that the secure configuration of Kubernetes is one of the primary challenges among practitioners. Moreover, there is a significant skill shortage of Kubernetes security experts. Understanding misconfigurations in Kubernetes can help practitioners prevent security incidents. We systematically investigate whether authentic learning can help students learn about misconfigurations in Kubernetes. We conduct an authentic learning exercise and collected responses from 295 students. Based on responses from the students, we find (i) students who have little to no experience in cybersecurity, software quality assurance, or static analysis perceived the authentic learning exercise as useful to learn misconfigurations in Kubernetes, and (ii) students perceptions of authentic learning exercise activities vary based on and educational background. We conclude our paper with recommendations for instructors and researchers.
